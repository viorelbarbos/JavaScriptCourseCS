        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
          Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming
          language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
          use of significant indentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports
          multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly
          procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often
          described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive
          standard library.
        </p>
        <h2>OpenCV</h2>
        <span
          >OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve
          computer vision problems. Python is a general purpose programming
          language started by Guido van Rossum that became very popular very
          quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability.</span
